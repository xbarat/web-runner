# Flight Booking System Issues Report

## Current Problems

### 1. Airline Names Not Showing
The system can't find the airline names on Google Flights. This is happening because:
- Google Flights has changed how they show airline names on their website
- Our current selectors (ways to find information on the page) are not matching the new way Google shows airline names
- Instead of real airline names like "American Airlines" or "Delta", we're getting "Unknown Airline"

### 2. Booking Process Failing
When trying to book a flight, the system can't complete the process because:
- After clicking on a flight, the system is looking for a "booking-details" section that doesn't exist
- Google Flights might have changed their booking flow
- The system times out after 5 seconds of trying to find the booking button

## What We See vs What Should Happen

### Current Behavior:
1. Shows flight prices and times correctly
2. Can't identify which airline is offering the flight
3. Clicking to book doesn't work

### Expected Behavior:
1. Should show complete flight information including airline names
2. Should be able to click through to the booking page
3. Should connect to the airline's website to complete the booking

## Technical Root Cause
1. **Airline Name Issue**: The selectors we're using to find airline names on the page are outdated. Google Flights has likely updated their website structure.

2. **Booking Process Issue**: The booking flow we're trying to follow doesn't match Google Flights' current design. We're looking for elements that either:
   - Don't exist anymore
   - Have different names/classes
   - Are loaded differently than before

## Next Steps
To fix these issues, we need to:
1. Update our airline name detection to match Google Flights' current layout
2. Revise the booking process to match the current Google Flights booking flow
3. Add better error handling and feedback when things don't work as expected
